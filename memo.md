### Memo

## to implement:
2 
Enable all clients connected to the service to see whenever a client
joins or leaves the chat. 
Add a user command to the client that allows the user to 
list users currently joined to the service.
If the client uses the .name command, this should be seen by all
connected clients.

+

2a Make the user information useful to the maintainer of the chat
service, so that the chat server console prints when someone
connects and disconnects. In the case of a disconnect, also print
session time (time between connect and disconnect), and how many
messages or Kbytes that user has sent.

## to run the modified program
run the install command in build.xml
to know more about the commands, 
you can search for the keyword: ant program and build.xml
then just run as the test goes.
